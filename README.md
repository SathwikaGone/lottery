rows.	There	must	be	at	least	two	columns.		The	widgets	must	include	buttons	
and	TextEdits.</br>
2) The TextEdits	allow	you	to	select	six	numbers	for	the	lottery.		Five	are	
regular	and	can	be	any	value	from	1	to	69.		The	sixth	is	for	the powerball	and	
can	be	from	1	to	26.	 The	TextEdits in	the	grid	must:</br>

b. Use	white	background	for	the	5	regular	numbers	and	red	for	the	
single	bonus	number.</br>
3) Six	Buttons	will	allow	the	player	to	generate	a	random	value	and	place	it	in	
the	corresponding	TextEdit</br>
a. On	click	it	will	generate	a	random	value	and	put	it in	the	EditText.</br>
b. Use	a	margin	or	padding	to	provide	some	separation	of	the	buttons.</br>
4) There	should	be	a	two	buttons	and	a	text	view	below	the	grid.	</br>	
a. The	clear	button	will	clear	all	the	values	in	the	EditTexts</br>

number	choices.</br>
c. The	TextView	will	record	a	ticket	purchase</br>
<p>Bonus:</p>	
Ø Guarantee	that	the	5	regular	numbers	are	different	before	you	purchase.		If	
not,	set	a	message	"Duplicate	number."</br>
Ø Guarantee	that	the	numbers	are	in	the	correct	range	before	you	purchase.		
Set	a	message	if	not.</br>
Ø When	you	print	the	5	regular	numbers	on	purchase,	put	them	in	increasing	
order.</br>
Ø Add	images	to	the	buttons.</br>
Ø Add	buttons	that	will	increase	the	corresponding	value	by	1.</br>
Ø Add	a	button	that	will	randomize	all	the	numbers.</br>
Ø Add	descriptive	labels.</br>
